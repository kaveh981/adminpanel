Firstly, reactive form is synchronous and template driven form is asynchronous.

Template Driven Forms Features

Easy to use:

Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
Similar to angular 1
Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
Minimal component code
Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
Unit testing is another challenge


Reactive Forms Features:

More flexible, but needs a lot of practice.
Handles any complex scenarios.
No data binding is done(Immutable data model preferred by most developers)
More component code and less HTML markup
Reactive transformations can be made possible such as
Handling a event based on a debounce time
Hanlding events when the components are distinct until changed
Adding elements dynamically
Easier Unit testing


Based on the research, Reactive forms provide us with more functunalities (for example auto-save), 
and possibilities(Unit testing) which make it a better choice when we build up an application from
scratch. However, template driven forms are simpler and are best to use when we migrating an 
Angular 1 application into Angular. Also by being synchronous, reactive forms allow a better control
over the inputs.
