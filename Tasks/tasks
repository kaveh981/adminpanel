    the api to get and employee with id is:
    http://mgm-mgm.193b.starter-ca-central-1.openshiftapps.com/employees/:id 
    the id should be replaced with the id of employee that we want to be edited and we have a save button
    to save edited employee password update should be in the same tab but in the different section and should have it's own save button
22-- When in the employee list we click on an employee a dynamic tab will be open the title of the tab is the name of the employee we clicked on
